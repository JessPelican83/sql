This SQL is in postgre. Im querying a database containing Netflix data to answer various questions.

*Initial joining of tables to see what data is available:
SELECT "netflix_people"."director", "netflix_titles_info"."type", "netflix_titles_info"."title" FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" ON "netflix_people"."show_id" = "netflix_titles_info"."show_id";

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? 
SELECT COUNT (titles.type)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
WHERE titles.type = 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 
SELECT titles.date_added
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ORDER BY date_added DESC;

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
ORDER BY title ASC; 

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 
SELECT people.director, titles.title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people ON titles.show_id = people.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
