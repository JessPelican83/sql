Here I am using SQLiteStudio to query some sales data.


HOW MANY ORDERS WERE PLACED IN JANUARY?

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers LIMIT 20;
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales LIMIT 20;
SELECT COUNT (orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE length (orderid) = 6 AND orderid<> 'OrderID';

How many of those were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT (orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE product = 'iPhone' AND length (orderid) = 6 AND orderid<> 'OrderID';

SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID;

SELECT product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;


Total revenue for each product sold in January?
Select product, price, quantity, (quantity*price) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
